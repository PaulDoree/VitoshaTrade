VitoshaTrade

VitoshaTrade is Distributed Artificial Neural Network trained by Differential 
Evolution for prediction of Forex. Project development is in Sofia, Bulgaria. 
Vitosha is a mountain massif, on the outskirts of Sofia, the capital of 
Bulgaria.

The idea of the project is MySQL-PHP-WinDLL based distributed ANN-DE for 
prediction of Forex indexes. This project is really innovative, because it is 
not common to use MySQL-PHP-WinDLL for distributed computing. Also the project 
implements full-connected neural network as predictor. The training is done by 
evolutionary algorithm.
